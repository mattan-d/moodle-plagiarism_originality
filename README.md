## Features

- **Advanced Plagiarism Detection:** The plugin employs state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze student submissions and compare them against a vast database and online sources to
  identify potential instances of plagiarism.

  an assignment, and a check box for the student.

  ghostwriting, be it a human, chatGPT, or a combination of both.

- **Intuitive Interface:** The plugin seamlessly integrates with the Moodle interface, ensuring a smooth user experience for both educators and students. The plagiarism-checking
  process is straightforward and can be easily initiated with a few simple clicks.
